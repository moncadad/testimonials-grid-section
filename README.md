## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been studying the design, breaking down the layout, looking for areas that have reusable styles. Figuring out the best implementation.
As well as using a BEM class naming approach. Overall I think it helps me pinpoint small details I would've missed if i'd blindly jumped into it.
This is just part of the planning.
I'm still pretty un experienced with grid but I feel like i'm getting by just fine.

### Continued development

Future projects, I'd like to better understand the many features grid has. Bento box is pretty trendy now I wonder whats to come.
I look forward to implementing bento sections into future projects. Bigger projects I'll definetly make my life easier using libraaries and frameworks as for now i'll keep it light when possible!

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns) - I'm still figuring it out!
